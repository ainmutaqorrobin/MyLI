# MyLI

Every group member is responsible for at least one module. For every module, the student 
should propose any suitable reporting. The report must implement a single table and join 
table using a structured query language (SQL). The basic requirements for MyLI are: 
 
Module 1: Module for BIM Administration (Manage User) 
1. Login
A login page with a session feature is a must. Log in to the system can be divided into three 
different users, BIM Admin, Faculty Supervisor(Lecturer), Faculty Coordinator, Industry 
Supervisor, Industrial Training Student.

2. User List
The module allows the system administrator to manage user profile, such as create new 
user, update, delete and view profile. 

3. Calculation
The user list should also provide information on the total number of users based on user 
types, department. Any other calculation relevant to the module can also be included. 

4. Report
A report that could give insightful information such as the total number for each user 
based on the residential college or any other report relevant to the module.

Module 2: Faculty Coordinator
 
1. Student-Lecturer List
Before the internship started, the faculty coordinator will assign a lecturer for each 
student that will undergo industrial training. Lecturer acted as the faculty supervisor that 
will monitor the student performance during the internship. Each lecturer will supervise 
a maximum of five students in a semester.

3. Student-Coordinator Platform
The faculty coordinator will broadcast any information, news, announcement related to 
the industrial training through MyLI. The faculty coordinator can update new companies 
interested in taking an internship and delete any company that is no longer interested or 
suitable to be industrial partners. Presentation schedule also is set out by faculty 
coordinator.

4. Calculation
The faculty coordinator needs to calculate the number of students who undergo 
internship based on the faculty's available department (e.g. Software Engineering, 
Networking 7 Multimedia for Faculty of Computing). The total mark given to the 
student by their industry and faculty supervisor is also needed. Any other calculation 
relevant to the module can also be included.

6. Report
A report in the form of visualization that could give insightful information such as a 
student with the highest performance mark, number of students undergo industrial 
training for that semester, student performance based on their department or any other 
report relevant to the module.

Module 3: Internship Student
 
 1. Activities List
During the internship, the student will access MyLI to insert their daily activities in the 
online logbook. Students are allowed to add, update and view the logbook.

2. Supervisor's Info
Student can view information about their supervisor; each student will have two 
supervisors. One from the faculty and the other one from the industry that they are 
attached to.
 
3. Calculation (Weekly Performance Mark)
Online logbooks should also record the mark given by the industry supervisor to the LI 
student weekly. This mark can then be summed up based on month so student 
performance throughout their industrial training can be monitor and analyses. Mark, 
given by the industry's supervisor during mid and end semester, can also be calculated. 
Any other calculation relevant to the module can also be included.

5. Report
A report in the form of visualization that could give insightful information such as 
student performance (based on mark given by the industry's supervisor), or attendances 
or any other report relevant to the module.

Module 4: Faculty Supervisor

1. Student List & Faculty Supervisor Info
The faculty supervisor will be attached to a maximum of 5 students. The faculty 
supervisor can view all students under their supervision, such as student id, name, phone 
number, email, details on the company the student is attached to and address. Faculty 
supervisors could also update their personal information if some of their information is 
outdated so that students can easily reach their faculty supervisor.

2. Student Progress
The lecturer can only view the students' progress based on the online logbook updated 
by their student weekly and has been evaluated by the industrial supervisor.

3. Calculation (Presentation, & Semester Mark)
Before the internship ended, students need to present their works to the assigned faculty 
supervisor. The faculty supervisor will monitor the student performance during the 
internship based on the industry supervisor's weekly mark. The faculty supervisor also 
needs to insert evaluation marks during the mid and end of the semester to MyLI. The 
calculation can be the total of mark mid and end semester assessment, or any other 
calculation relevant to the module.

5. Report 
A report in the form of visualization could give insightful information such as student 
performance (based on mark given by the industry's supervisor) or comparison of 
weekly, mid-term or final semester marks between students supervised under the same 
faculty supervisor.

Module 5: Industry Supervisor

1. Student List & Industry Supervisor Info 
Industry supervisor can view the information students under their supervision, such as 
student id, name, phone number, email, details on the company the student is attached 
to and address. Industry supervisor could also update their personal information if some 
of their information is incorrect or outdated so that student and faculty supervisor can 
reach them easily.

2. Student Progress 
The industrial supervisor can view the students' progress and, at the same time, provide 
feedback or comment based on the progress inserted by their student in the online 
logbook. Feedback from the industry supervisor on student performance weekly is 
essential for the online logbook.
 
3. Calculation (Weekly & Semester Performance Mark)
Besides weekly performance, the industrial supervisor also needs to insert evaluation 
marks during the mid and end of the semester to MyLI. The calculation can be the total 
mark from mid and end of semester assessment. Total mark from the weekly 
performance or any other calculation relevant to the module.

4. Report 
A report in the form of visualization could give insightful information such as student 
performance (based on mark given by the industry's supervisor) or comparison of 
weekly, mid-term or final semester marks between students supervised under the same 
faculty supervisor.
